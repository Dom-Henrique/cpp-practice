# C++ Projects to Practice
Hey! I'm Lord Henry - or Dom Henrique, if you're portuguese speaker.

Recently i've practed C programming language resolving questions of my friend [Bernardo Alencar](https://github.com/F-Bernardo-09) from Associate's Degree of Software Development in Federal Institute of Paraiba, and searching channels in YouTube and talking with my friends [Pedro Arthur](https://github.com/Pedro-Arthur13) and [João Pedro](https://github.com/JoaoPedroli), i've discovery the competitive programming.

Whatching videos in YouTube, they say that C++ is most language used into competitive programming. The reason is the flexibility and ligth complexity, compared to languages like Assembly, beyond your support of OOP.
